# MachineLearning
A collection of various algorithms under ML coded in Python.

##Python Libraries:
1. numPy: NumPy is the fundamental package(library) needed for scientific computing with Python.It provides:

* a powerful N-dimensional array object
* sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
* tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
* useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

2. matplotlib.pyplot: It is a state-based interface to matplotlib. It provides a MATLAB-like way of plotting.
pyplot is mainly intended for interactive plots and simple cases of programmatic plot generation. 
Matplotlib is a python library inspired by MATLAB whereas pyplot is a shell-like interface to matplotlib, to make it easier to use for people used to MATLAB.

3. pandas: Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis/manipulation tool available in any language.

##Data Files:
* .csv files: A comma-separated values file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. A CSV file stores tabular data in plain text. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas.

##Functions
* Fit(): calculates the value of parameters.
* Transform(): Fits data according to th parameter values.
* Fit_transform(): Calculates paramteres according to data and then transforms it.
